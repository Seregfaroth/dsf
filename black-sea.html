				<h3>Management Problem</h3>
				<p>The Black Sea turbot (<em>Psetta maxima maeotica</em>) is a highly valuable commercial species, which has been subjected severe decline in recent decades. The main reasons for the decline appears to be overfishing, in particular due to Illegal, Unreported, and Unregulated (IUU) fishing, but the stock development has also been adversely affected by environmental change (including eutrophication and invasive species).  Recent assessments of the turbot stock have been based on different assumptions about stock structure but reach similar conclusions, namely that the stock is subjected to highly unstainable fishing pressure and is in need of a recovery plan. The case study will benefit from, and ideally contribute to, an ongoing GFCM initiative to develop a management plan for the Black Sea turbot (GFCM, 2014)<a href="black-sea.html#ref1" name="ref1-link-a"><sup>1</sup></a>.</p>
				<h3>Management Setting</h3>
				<p>The case study will be based on the assumption that the western stock of Turbot can regarded separate stock, fished by Ukraine, Bulgaria and Romania<a href="black-sea.html#ref2" name="ref2-link"><sup>2</sup></a>. Although the evidence in support of this assumption is not conclusive, expert believe that it more likely than the assumption that there is a common turbot stock for the whole Black sea, which has been the basis for most stock assessment in the past.</p>
				<p>Currently, there is no established agreement on the management of fisheries in the Black Sea<a href="black-sea.html#ref3" name="ref3-link"><sup>3</sup></a>. However, the General Fisheries Commission for the Mediterranean is a highly important body for cooperation and coordination with regard to fisheries management. Romania and Bulgaria are members of the GCFM, which has authority to adopt binding measures for its members. Ukraine’s is not a full member of GFCM but its affiliation with the Commission has recently been strengthened and formalized as a “Cooperating non-Contracting Party”. Bulgaria, Romania and Ukraine participates in an ongoing GFCM initiative to develop a common management plan for Black Sea turbot<a href="black-sea.html#ref1" name="ref1-link-b"><sup>1</sup></a>.</p>
				<p>More information on the management setting for Black Sea turbot can be found recent GCFM background report<a href="black-sea.html#ref4" name="ref4-link"><sup>4</sup></a>.</p>
				<h3>Objectives</h3>
				<p>The case study associates itself with the ongoing GFCM initiative for to develop a management plan for common for Black. The objective and operational objectives for the case study (see below) are therefore obtained from this initiative, although they may be revised and made more explicit later in consultation with stakeholders and case study researchers.</p>

				<h3>Case study approach</h3>
				<p>Stakeholders are cooperating with Mareframe researchers propose  a management plan. The process  includes the following steps:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Identify management problem(s)</li>
					<li>Identify  objectives and indicators</li>
					<li>Implement models</li>
					<li>Develop management alternatives</li>
					<li>Evaluate alternatives (decision support)</li>
					<li>Select best alternative </li>
					<li>Draft management proposal</li>
				</ol>
